# Dog-Licensing

The city of Seattle makes available its database of pet licenses issued from 2005 to the beginning of 2017 as part of the city's ongoing Open Data Initiative. The data is also obtainable from the Socrata Open Data Access (SODA) portal in either CSV or JSON formats.

Each entry in the dataset represents a unique dog license that was active during the year. However, it may not represent a unique dog, as a renewed license within the year creates a separate record for the new active license period. Thus, each entry corresponds to a distinct license period for the dog within the annual timeframe.

This dataset is valuable for municipal governments, veterinarians, and researchers interested in pet ownership trends, compliance with local licensing regulations, and demographic studies of pet ownership. Additionally, it can assist in public health monitoring, such as tracking rabies vaccinations, which are often required for licensing.

The Seattle Pet Licenses dataset was compiled by the City of Seattle Department of Finance and Administrative Services through the city of Seattle's Open Data initiative, and all credit goes to the original creators and maintainers of the data, the Seattle Animal Shelter. 

The city of Seattle requires pets over eight weeks old be licensed. There are several benefits to licensing one's pet, including a return ride home if your pet is lost, and easier contact from a veterinarian if your pet is unfortunately injured. If the licensing is performed at the Seattle Animal Shelter on the third Saturday of any given month, a free rabies vaccine is included, as well as other vaccines and a microchip for a small additional fee.
