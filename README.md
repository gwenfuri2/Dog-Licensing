# Dog-Licensing

All dog owners living in NYC are legally required to license their dogs. The data is obtained from the DOHMH Dog Licensing System, where owners can apply for and renew their dog licenses.

Each entry in the dataset represents a unique dog license that was active during the year. However, it may not represent a unique dog, as a renewed license within the year creates a separate record for the new active license period. Thus, each entry corresponds to a distinct license period for the dog within the annual timeframe.

This dataset is valuable for municipal governments, veterinarians, and researchers interested in pet ownership trends, compliance with local licensing regulations, and demographic studies of pet ownership. Additionally, it can assist in public health monitoring, such as tracking rabies vaccinations, which are often required for licensing.
